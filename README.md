# Bank_Management_System
<h3>Context or Problem Statement:</h3>
This was my first project, and I wanted to build something that simulated real-world scenarios while helping me strengthen my Python skills. Banking is a critical domain where efficient management of accounts and transactions is essential. I decided to create a Bank Management System that could handle core banking operations like creating accounts, managing transactions, and deleting accounts, all through a simple and user-friendly backend interface. The goal was to develop a system that replicates basic banking functionality, focusing on accuracy and reliability.


<h3>Overview of the Project:</h3>
My project is a Python-based backend application that uses object-oriented programming principles. 
<h4>It consists of two main classes:</h4>
<h4>I.BankAccount Class:</h4>This handles individual accounts, storing details like account number, account name, and balance. It also provides methods for depositing and withdrawing money and displaying account details.

<h4>II.Bank Class:</h4>This acts as the central management system, maintaining multiple accounts in a dictionary for quick access. It includes methods to create new accounts, delete existing ones, and access account details.

The program has a menu-driven interface that allows users to interact with the system.
<h4>The main features include:</h4>

<h4>I.Account Creation:</h4>Users can create accounts by providing an account number, name, and optional initial balance.

<h4>II.Deposits and Withdrawals:</h4>Users can securely add or withdraw money, with checks for sufficient balance during withdrawals.

<h4>III.Account Details:</h4>Users can view account information like name, number, and current balance.

<h4>IV.Account Deletion:</h4>Accounts can be removed when no longer needed.

<p>The system handles edge cases, such as preventing duplicate account creation or withdrawals beyond the available balance. This ensured that the system mimicked real-world banking constraints.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
This project was an excellent starting point for me to understand how real-world systems work and how to translate them into functional code. It allowed me to learn and apply concepts like object-oriented programming, error handling, and data storage using Python’s dictionaries. While the project is a backend application, it is designed to be scalable, meaning it can be integrated with a frontend or a database in the future to make it a complete banking solution. This project helped me develop a solid foundation for backend development, problem-solving, and logical thinking, skills I am confident will add value to any team.Being my first project, it not only boosted my confidence but also inspired me to take on more complex projects in the future.
