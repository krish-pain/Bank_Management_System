# Bank_Management_System
<h3>Context or Problem Statement:</h3>
This was my first project, and I wanted to build something that simulated real-world scenarios while helping me strengthen my Python skills. Banking is a critical domain where efficient management of accounts and transactions is essential. I decided to create a Bank Management System that could handle core banking operations like creating accounts, managing transactions, and deleting accounts, all through a simple and user-friendly backend interface. The goal was to develop a system that replicates basic banking functionality, focusing on accuracy and reliability.

<h3>Overview of the Project:</h3>
My project is a Python-based backend application that uses object-oriented programming principles. 
It consists of two main classes:

<h5>I.BankAccount Class:</h5>
                        This handles individual accounts, storing details like account number, account name, and balance. It also provides methods for 
                        depositing and withdrawing money and displaying account details.

II.Bank Class: This acts as the central management system, maintaining multiple accounts in a dictionary for quick access. It includes methods to create new accounts, delete existing ones, and access account details.

The program has a menu-driven interface that allows users to interact with the system. The main features include:

I.Account Creation: Users can create accounts by providing an account number, name, and optional initial balance.

II.Deposits and Withdrawals: Users can securely add or withdraw money, with checks for sufficient balance during withdrawals.

III.Account Details: Users can view account information like name, number, and current balance.

IV.Account Deletion: Accounts can be removed when no longer needed.

The system handles edge cases, such as preventing duplicate account creation or withdrawals beyond the available balance. This ensured that the system mimicked real-world banking constraints.

3. Conclusion:
This project was an excellent starting point for me to understand how real-world systems work and how to translate them into functional code. It allowed me to learn and apply concepts like object-oriented programming, error handling, and data storage using Pythonâ€™s dictionaries.

While the project is a backend application, it is designed to be scalable, meaning it can be integrated with a frontend or a database in the future to make it a complete banking solution. This project helped me develop a solid foundation for backend development, problem-solving, and logical thinking, skills I am confident will add value to any team.

Being my first project, it not only boosted my confidence but also inspired me to take on more complex projects in the future.
